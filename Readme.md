# My Path of Building (PoB) Builds

This repo is a personal archive of **Path of Exile** character builds I’ve used, tweaked, and trusted over many leagues. All builds are compatible with the community fork of **Path of Building** (aka PoB Community Edition).

Think of this as my “build graveyard” — some are league-starters, some carried me to endgame, and a few are just experiments that somehow worked. If you’re looking for tried-and-tested setups (or just curious how I min-maxed my way through Wraeclast), you’re in the right place.

## What’s Included
- `.xml` files for each build (ready to import into PoB)
- Build notes with key gear, skill links, and playstyle tips
- Occasional “why this works” commentary (because theorycrafting is half the fun)

## How to Use
1. Install [Path of Building Community Edition](https://github.com/PathOfBuildingCommunity/PathOfBuilding).
2. Clone or download this repo.
3. In PoB: **File → Import → From File** and pick any `.xml` from this folder.
4. Tweak, test, and wreck monsters.

> ⚠️ **Note**: Builds are **not actively maintained** after a league ends, so check the date and patch version before diving in. What worked in 3.22 might melt in 3.25.

## Why Share This?
Because I’ve benefited from countless public builds over the years — consider this my tiny pay-it-forward. Feel free to borrow, adapt, or laugh at my questionable gem choices.

GLHF, Exile.
